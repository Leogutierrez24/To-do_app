# Hello there, let me tell you about this app 

Like in the preview, it is an app to keep your pending task and see all those you have already completed.

In the functionalities you will find 4: compete, restore, delete and edit a task.

All the data is persisted in the local storage API.

## Dependencies

The app was created with create-react-app so you will need all those dependencies that the command install by default.

Another dependency I used was react-router-dom.

That's all, thank you for reading.
